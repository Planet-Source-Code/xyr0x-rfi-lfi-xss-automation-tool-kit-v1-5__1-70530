## RFI / LFI / XSS Automation tool kit v1\.5


</div>

### Description

Has the same purpose as the previous versions, the only thing that is new is that the XSS (Cross Site Scripting) has reporting and automation(automatic injection done through the client)No clicking for each string required. I have also nested an unfinished string crafter for writing custom strings to inject on the fly, which is unfinished. Anyway, have fun.
