Ah, hey. Well doesn't this GUI look familar! =P

Yeah, it's crappy mimic of Rapid Hacker, but this is just a rough update to my ancient rfi/lfi/xss tool kit, with a few 
updates and additions. Mainly so far I've written an automation process to the XSS(cross.site.scripting) feature. I did 
not automate the RFI/LFI because I don't have all the time anymore. If in case you haven't noticed all of the time I've 
wasted...

No enthusiasm anymore. I guess. Besides this is just a Temporary Hobby.

I haven't implemented the "Crafter" which allows you to output custom strings on the fly. So if you want to go ahead 
and finish that you can.

This project is over, and was more of a weak-challenge for a few people; because it's always amusing to see who can 
write the lamest tool of this nature and watch the little ones run off crying and calling me an asshole, dick, et cetera. 

But what can I say. That's a 15 year old.
